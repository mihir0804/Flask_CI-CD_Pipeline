Flask CI/CD Pipeline
Overview
This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for a Python-based Flask REST API. The pipeline automates code testing, linting, containerization with Docker, and deployment through GitHub Actions. It serves as a practical example of how modern development teams streamline software delivery using CI/CD practices.

Features
REST API built with Flask

Unit testing with pytest

Code linting with flake8

Containerized using Docker

Automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

Deployment to cloud (Heroku or Render)

Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python 3.10

Framework: Flask

Testing: Pytest

Linting: Flake8

CI/CD Tool: GitHub Actions

Containerization: Docker

Deployment: Heroku / Render

CI/CD Workflow
Code Quality Check – Flake8 runs on every push to ensure code follows PEP8 standards.

Automated Testing – Pytest runs unit tests to validate API functionality.

Docker Build – Application is containerized with Docker.

Docker Push – Image is pushed to DockerHub.

Deployment – Application is deployed to Heroku/Render automatically after tests pass.

How to Run Locally
Prerequisites
Python 3.10+

Docker (optional, for containerized execution)

Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask-ci-cd-pipeline.git
cd flask-ci-cd-pipeline
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask API:

bash

Run Tests:

bash
Copy
Edit
pytest
Run with Docker:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t flask-ci-cd .
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-ci-cd
Deployment
This project can be deployed to:

Heroku: Using a Procfile and GitHub integration.

Render: Connect GitHub repo for auto-deployments.

AWS/GCP/Azure: Deploy Docker image using ECS, Cloud Run, or App Service.

Use Case in Industry
This project demonstrates real-world software delivery practices:

Automating testing and deployment ensures code reliability.

Docker makes the application portable and easy to scale.

CI/CD with GitHub Actions reduces manual effort, enabling faster releases.

Useful in web development, data engineering, and machine learning deployment scenarios.
